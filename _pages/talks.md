This page lists various talks I've given, and also links to video recording where/when available.

As luck would have it, These decks are blessed by the powers that be with various SVG animations; to that end, I've incorporated a visual aid to make that clear.  
<span class="uk-label">Hint</span>: These animations are triggered by your mouse pointer / finger-touch *inside* them. The animations will immediately stop/freeze once the pointer is out of the drawing area, and resume again when inside...  
Use this wisely. From here-on, I'll use the following icon when I have a thing-a-majig that animates:<br/><object style="margin: auto" type="image/svg+xml" data="../talks/intrinsics-sorting-2019/play.svg"></object>
